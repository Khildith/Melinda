    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Melinda Canny is a world traveler, Army Veteran, amateur photographer,
        published poet and lifelong storyteller. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Her Ashwind series follows a group of magically gifted kids who must learn
        to work together to save their realm. To do so, some must battle discrimination because of
        their disabilities or race. Others have to overcome the fear they have of the abilities they've
        been given.
    </p>
    <p>
        Melinda has seen the profound effect that happens when children with disabilities are looked
        down upon. Her own son was in Special Ed and people constantly underestimated him. She
        worked hard to let him know that the only thing that made him different was the way he
        learned. He succeeded in everything he tried. Melinda wants other children with disabilities to
        know that they have value and can do most anything they want.
