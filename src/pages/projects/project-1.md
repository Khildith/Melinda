### Ashwind: The Choosing

In the debut of Ashwind Castle, malevolence strikes the Lion Room just as it prepares to unveil its secrets. With the essence of the Lion Room forced into hiding, the remaining six chambers must hastily select their champions, bereft of a guiding leader. Amidst chaos, a reluctant young boy is chosen to stand in, tasked with aiding the Guides in their quest to reclaim the essence of the Lion's Room. Yet, as time slips away, the insidious grasp of evil tightens around the chosen one, threatening the very core of the room's existence. Will darkness prevail, or can light emerge victorious in this gripping battle for salvation?
